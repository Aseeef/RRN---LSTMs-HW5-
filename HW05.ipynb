    "# CS 505 Homework 05:  Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Due Friday  11/17 at midnight (1 minute after 11:59 pm) in Gradescope (with a grace period of 6 hours)\n",
    "#### You may submit the homework up to 24 hours late (with the same grace period) for a penalty of 10%. \n",
    "\n",
    "All homeworks will be scored with a maximum of 100 points; point values are given\n",
    "for individual problems, and if parts of problems do not have point values given, they\n",
    "will be counted equally toward the total for that problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This homework is a bit different from the first four in this class in that in some parts we are specified **what** you need to do for your solutions, but much less of the **how** you write the details of the code. There are three reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a graduate level CS class, after four homeworks and two months of lectures, you should be well-equipped to work out the coding issues for yourself, and in general, going forward, this is how you will solve the kinds of problems presented here; \n",
    "- Suggestions for resources (mostly ML blogs) will be suggested; there are many resources, but these are from bloggers that I trust and have used in the past;\n",
    "- I am expecting that you will make good use of chatGPT for help with the details of syntax and low-level organization of your code. There is often nothing very stimulating or informative about precisely what is the syntax needed for a particular kind of layer in a network, and rather than poke around on StackOverflow, chatGPT is particularly good at summarizing existing approaches to ML coding tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "You must complete the homework by editing <b>this notebook</b> and submitting the following two files in Gradescope by the due date and time:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A file <code>HW05.ipynb</code> (be sure to select <code>Kernel -> Restart and Run All</code> before you submit, to make sure everything works); and\n",
    "  - A file <code>HW05.pdf</code> created from the previous.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For best results obtaining a clean PDF file on the Mac, select <code>File -> Print Review</code> from the Jupyter window, then choose <code>File-> Print</code> in your browser and then <code>Save as PDF</code>.  Something  similar should be possible on a Windows machine -- just make sure it is readable and no cell contents have been cut off. Make it easy to grade!\n",
    "  \n",
    "The date and time of your submission is the last file you submitted, so if your IPYNB file is submitted on time, but your PDF is late, then your submission is late. "

    "<a href=\"https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/snyder/cs505/CharacterLevelLSTM.ipynb\">IPYNB</a>. Your first step is to download this and run it in Colab (or download the data file, which is in the CS 505 Data Directory and also linked on the web site, and run it on your local machine) and understand all its various features. Most of it is straight-forward at this point in the course, but the definition of the model is a bit messy, and you will need to read about LSTM layers in the Pytorch documents to really understand what it is doing and what the hyperparameters mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also take a look at the article \"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks\" linked with lecture 14. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, you will run this code on a dataset consisting of Java code files, which has been uploaded to the CS 505 Data Directory and also to the class web site: <a href=\"https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/snyder/cs505/JavaFiles/\">DIR</a>  Select some number of these files and concatenate them into one long text file, such that you have approximately 10-20K characters (if you have trouble running out of RAM you can use fewer, but try to get at least 10K). \n",
    "\n",
    "You will run the character-level model on this dataset. You may either cut and paste code into this notebook, or submit the file with your changes and output along with this notebook to Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to get a character-level model that has not simply memorized the Java text file by overfitting, and does not do much other than spit out random characters (underfitting).  You will get the former if you simply run it for many epochs without any changes to the hyperparameters; you will get the latter if you run it only a few epochs. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should experiment with different hyperparameters, which in the notebook are indicated\n",

    "experiment with the various hyperparameters to try to avoid overfitting. See my lectures on T 10/31 and Th 11/2 (recorded and on my YT channel) for the background to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the code you will work from does not use validation and testing sets, nor does it calculate the accuracy, but only tracks the loss. The nature of the data sets for character-level models does not seem to lend itself to accuracy metrics, but you may wish to try this -- I have not found it to be useful, but have simply focussed on the output and \"eyeballed\" the results to determine how much they have generalized\n",

    "- Develop your code in Pytorch, not Keras\n",
    "- Use the novel *Persuation* by Jane Austen as your training data (available through the Brown Corpus); if you have trouble with RAM you will need to cut down the number of sentences (perhaps by eliminating the longest sentences as well, see next point). \n",
    "- Develop a sentence-level model by padding sentences to the maximum sentence length in the novel (if this seems extreme, you may wish to delete a small number of the longest sentences to reduce the maximum length). Surround your data sentences with `<s>` and `</s>` and your model should generate one sentence at a time (as you did in HW 03), i.e., it should stop if it generates the `</s>` token. \n",
    "- Use pretrained GLoVe embeddings with dimension 200, and update them (refine by training further) on the sentences in the novel; if you have trouble with RAM you may use a smaller dimension. \n",
    "- Experiment with the hyperparameters (sample length, number of layers, uni- or bi-directional, weight_decay, dropout, number of epochs, temperature of the softmax, etc.) as you did in Problem One to find the \"sweet spot\" where you are generating interesting-looking sentences but not simply repeating sentences from the data. You may want to try adding more linear layers on top to pick the most likely next word. \n",
    "- Generate sentences using Beam Search, which we describe below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution should be the code, samples of sentences generated with their score (described below), and your description of the investigation of various hyperparameters, and what strategy ended up seeming to generate the most realistic sentences that were not simply a repeat of sentences in the data. \n"
